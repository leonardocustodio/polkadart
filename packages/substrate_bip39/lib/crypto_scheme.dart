  ///   - the path may be followed by `///`, in which case everything after the `///` is treated
  /// as a password.
  /// - If `string` begins with a `/` character it is prefixed with the Substrate public `DEV_PHRASE`
  ///   and interpreted as above.
  ///
  /// In this case they are interpreted as HDKD junctions; purely numeric items are interpreted as
  /// integers, non-numeric items as strings. Junctions prefixed with `/` are interpreted as soft
  /// junctions, and with `//` as hard junctions.

  /// There is no correspondence mapping between `SURI` strings and the keys they represent.

  /// Notably, integer junction indices may be legally prefixed with arbitrary number of zeros.

  /// generally be equivalent to no password at all.
