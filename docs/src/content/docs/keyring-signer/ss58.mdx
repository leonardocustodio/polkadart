title: SS58 Address Format
---

The SS58 address format is the standard for encoding and decoding addresses in the Polkadot ecosystem.
It is based on the Bitcoin Base-58-check encoding, with a few modifications designed for the needs of Polkadot-based chains.
With this format it is possible to identity to which network a given address belongs, and to encode and decode addresses for different networks.

## Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  ss58: ^1.1.3
```

Get the dependencies by running:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Usage

### Decoding an Address

```dart
final address = Address.decode('1zugcag7cJVBtVRnFxv5Qftn7xKAnR6YJ9x4x3XLgGgmNnS');
```

### Registry Info by Prefix

```dart
// get registry info of given `prefix`

final polkadotRegistry = Codec.registry.getByPrefix(0);

print('polkadot registry: $polkadotRegistry');
```

### Decoding Substrate Address

```dart
// decoding substrate address

final String originalEncodedAddress = '5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY';

final List<int> decodedBytes = Codec.fromNetwork('substrate').decode(originalEncodedAddress);

print('Substrate address bytes: $decodedBytes');
```

### Encoding bytes to produce address

```dart
// Encoding the decodedBytes to produce back encodedAddress.

final int substrateAddressPrefix = 42;

final encodedAddress = Codec(substrateAddressPrefix).encode(decodedBytes);

print(encodedAddress);
```
