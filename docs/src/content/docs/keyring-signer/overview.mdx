One of the most important aspects of working with blockchain is the ability of signing transactions. The Polkadart Keyring package provide a convenient way to manage key pairs and sign transactions.

#### Installation


Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  polkadart_keyring: ^0.4.4
```

Get the dependencies by running:

```bash
dart pub get
```

#### Sample usage

```dart title="demo.dart"
import 'package:polkadart_keyring/polkadart_keyring.dart';

Future<void> main(List<String> arguments) async {
  final keyring = Keyring();
  final keyPair = await keyring.fromUri('//Alice');

  print('Alice address: ${keyPair.address}');
}
```

You will get the following output:

```dart
Alice address: 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
