title: Ink ABI
---

Dart library for handling ink! smart contract metadata.

## Requirements

Ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

* Dart `>=3.6.0`
* Compatible with Flutter and pure Dart projects

## Installation

To install `ink_abi` in your Dart project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ink_abi: any
```

Then, run:

```sh
  dart pub get
```
or
```sh
  flutter pub get
```

## ABI Support

Ink! smart contract metadata serves as a blueprint for how a contract is structured and interacts with external systems. It defines storage layouts, executable methods, and data types, ensuring seamless communication between the contract and its callers. This makes it easier for developers to build, analyze, and integrate contracts efficiently across different platforms.

Currently, `ink_abi` supports metadata versions: **v3, v4, v5**.

## Example Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to load and parse an ink! contract metadata file:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:ink_abi/ink_abi_base.dart';

void main() {
  // Define the path to the metadata JSON file
  final String dir = Directory.current.absolute.path;
  final String jsonFilePath = '$dir/your_metadata_json_file.json';

  // Read and parse JSON metadata
  final json = jsonDecode(File(jsonFilePath).readAsStringSync());
  
  // Initialize InkAbi with parsed metadata
  final InkAbi inkAbi = InkAbi(json);
}
```

This initializes an `InkAbi` instance using metadata from a JSON file, allowing interaction with the contract in a structured manner.
