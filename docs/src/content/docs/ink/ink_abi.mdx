title: Ink ABI
---

Dart library for handling ink! smart contract metadata.

## Requirements

Ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- Dart `>=3.6.0`
- Compatible with Flutter and pure Dart projects

## Installation

To install `ink_abi` in your Dart project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ink_abi: any
```

Then, run:

```sh
  dart pub get
```

or

```sh
  flutter pub get
```

## ABI Support

Ink! smart contract metadata serves as a blueprint for how a contract is structured and interacts with external systems. It defines storage layouts, executable methods, and data types, ensuring seamless communication between the contract and its callers. This makes it easier for developers to build, analyze, and integrate contracts efficiently across different platforms.

Currently, `ink_abi` supports metadata versions: **v3, v4, v5**.

## Example Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to load and parse the metadata for a Flipper smart contract:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:ink_abi/ink_abi_base.dart';

void main() {
  // Read and parse the Flipper contract metadata
  final json = jsonDecode(File('flipper.json').readAsStringSync());

  // Initialize InkAbi with Flipper metadata
  final InkAbi inkAbi = InkAbi(json);
}
```

This initializes an `InkAbi` instance using metadata from the Flipper contract JSON file, allowing interaction with the Flipper contract's flip and get methods in a structured manner.
