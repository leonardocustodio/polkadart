title: Getting Started with ink! Smart Contracts
---

The Polkadart ink! packages provide tools for interacting with ink! smart contracts from Dart and Flutter applications. You can use these packages to parse contract metadata, generate type-safe bindings, deploy contracts and interact with them.

#### Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  ink_abi: ^0.2.2
  ink_cli: ^0.2.2
```

Get the dependencies by running:

```bash
dart pub get
```

#### Sample usage

```dart title="demo.dart"
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:ink_abi/ink_abi.dart';
import 'package:ink_cli/ink_cli.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Parse contract metadata
  final json = jsonDecode(File('flipper.json').readAsStringSync());
  final abi = InkAbi(json);

  // Generate Dart bindings
  final generator = TypeGenerator(
    abiFilePath: 'flipper.json',
    fileOutput: FileOutput('generated_flipper.dart')
  );
  generator.generate();

  print('Contract ABI loaded and bindings generated');
}
```

This will load the Flipper contract metadata and generate type-safe Dart bindings for interacting with the contract.

The ink! packages allow you to work with smart contracts in a type-safe way, making contract interactions more reliable and maintainable.
