ink! is a Rust-based domain-specific language for writing WebAssembly smart contracts that provides specialized #[ink(...)] attribute macros enabling secure and efficient smart contract development on Substrate-based chains.

Before proceeding, ensure you have followed the complete setup guide at https://use.ink/getting-started/setup to configure your development environment with all required dependencies including Rust, cargo-contract, and other tools.

#### Creating Your First Contract

Create a new ink! contract project:

```bash title="Create new contract"
cargo contract new flipper
cd flipper
```

Build the contract to generate the Wasm bundle:

```bash title="Build contract"
cargo contract build
```

This will generate the `.contract` bundle file in `target/ink/`.

#### Deploying Your Contract

First, start your local node (if you haven't installed it yet, follow the guide at https://use.ink/getting-started/running-substrate):

```bash title="Start local node"
substrate-contracts-node
```

Then the contract can be deployed using the contracts UI:

```dart title="Deploy steps"
1. Go to https://ui.use.ink
2. Select "Local Node" from the dropdown at top left
3. Click "Add New Contract" in sidebar
4. Click "Upload New Contract Code"
5. Select deployment account (e.g. ALICE)
6. Name your contract (e.g. "Flipper")
7. Drag & drop the .contract file
8. Click "Next"
9. Accept default settings
10. Click "Upload and Instantiate"
```
