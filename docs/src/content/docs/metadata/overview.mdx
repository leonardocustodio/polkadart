title: Overview

In this section we will show you how to interact with network-specific APIs that are generated by the Polkadart CLI. These APIs are specific to the network you are connecting to and provide all the methods available on that network in a type-safe way.

#### Installation

To have access to the network-specific APIs, you need to install the Polkadart CLI and generate the types for the network you are interested in.
If you already did that on the [Getting Started](/getting-started/installation) section, you can skip this step.

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  polkadart_cli: ^0.4.7
```

Get the dependencies by running:

```bash
dart pub get
```

#### Generating the APIs

Now let's configure Polkadart CLI to generate the types for us, add the following configuration at the end of your pubspec file.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
polkadart:
  output_dir: lib/generated
  chains:
    polkadot: wss://rpc.polkadot.io
    kusama: wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io
```

And finally let's generate the types:

```bash
dart run polkadart_cli:generate -v
```

You will see that a folder `lib/generated` was created for you and it contains all APIs, types and extrinsics for the networks you specified.

We will provide the same example as the one in the [Polkadart API](/api/overview) section, but this time using the network-specific APIs.

## Example: StateApi

```dart title="demo.dart"
import 'package:demo/generated/polkadot/polkadot.dart';
import 'package:polkadart/polkadart.dart' show Provider;

Future<void> main(List<String> arguments) async {
  final provider = Provider.fromUri(Uri.parse('wss://rpc.polkadot.io'));
  final polkadot = Polkadot(provider);
  final runtime = await polkadot.rpc.state.getRuntimeVersion();

  print(runtime.toJson());
}
```

You will get the same output as the Polkadart API example on [StateApi](/api/state#sample-usage) section:

```dart
{
	specName: polkadot,
	implName: parity-polkadot,
	authoringVersion: 0,
	specVersion: 1003003,
	implVersion: 0,
	apis: [...],
	transactionVersion: 26,
	stateVersion: 1
}
```

## Example: SystemApi

```dart title="demo.dart"
import 'package:polkadart/apis/apis.dart';
import 'package:polkadart/polkadart.dart' show Provider;

void main() async {
  final provider = Provider.fromUri(Uri.parse('wss://rpc.polkadot.io'));
  final polkadot = Polkadot(provider);
  final chain = await polkadot.rpc.system.chain();

  print(chain);
}
```

You will get the same output as the Polkadart API example on [SystemApi](/api/system#sample-usage) section:

```dart
Polkadot
```

## Next steps

The following sections will provide more details on the available APIs for polkadot network.
The APIs are generated based on a snapshot of the network in the time of writing, please keep in mind that the network may have changed since then.
