title: Connecting to a network
---

After you have installed Polkadart and generated the types, you can now connect to a network and start querying the chain.

#### Using Provider and the generated API

Let's create a sample application together, inside `bin/demo.dart` let's add the following code:

```dart title="demo.dart"
import 'package:demo/generated/polkadot/polkadot.dart';
import 'package:polkadart/provider.dart';

Future<void> main(List<String> arguments) async {
  final provider = Provider.fromUri(Uri.parse('wss://rpc.polkadot.io'));
  final polkadot = Polkadot(provider);

  final query = await polkadot.rpc.state.getRuntimeVersion();
  print(query.toJson());
}
```

Now you can run your application:

```bash
dart run bin/demo.dart
```

You should see the runtime version of the Polkadot chain.

```dart
{
	specName: polkadot,
	implName: parity-polkadot,
	authoringVersion: 0,
	specVersion: 1003003,
	implVersion: 0,
	apis: [...],
	transactionVersion: 26,
	stateVersion: 1
}
```

You have now successfully connected to a Polkadot and made your first query to the chain! ðŸš€
