title: Type generator
---

Type generation is a crucial part of working with Polkadot and Polkadot based chains.
Each network has its own set of types, APIs, extrinsics and Polkadart provides a way to generate these types for you.
This makes it easier to work with any chains with the security of type-safety and auto-completion.

#### Generating types

We will use Polkadart CLI to generate the types for us, add the following configuration at the end of your pubspec file.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
polkadart:
  output_dir: lib/generated
  chains:
    polkadot: wss://rpc.polkadot.io
    kusama: wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io
```

Now let's generate the types:

```bash
dart run polkadart_cli:generate -v
```

You will see that a folder `lib/generated` was created for you with everything you need to start working with Polkadot and Kusama.
