title: System API
---

The System API provides a way to query the system information of the blockchain. It allows you to query the chain name, version, health, and more.
This API is available through the `SystemApi` class from the `polkadart` package.

### Sample usage

```dart
import 'package:polkadart/apis/apis.dart';
import 'package:polkadart/polkadart.dart' show Provider;

void main() async {
  final provider = Provider.fromUri(Uri.parse('wss://rpc.polkadot.io'));
  final systemApi = SystemApi(provider);
  final chain = await systemApi.chain();

  print(chain);
}
```

You will get the following output:

```dart
Polkadot
```

## Methods

There are several methods available in the `SystemApi` class that allow you to query the system information of the blockchain. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:

### name

```dart
Future<String> name()
```

Get the node's implementation name. Plain old string.

### version

```dart
Future<String> version()
```

Get the node implementation's version. Should be a semver string.

### chain

```dart
Future<String> chain()
```

Get the chain's name. Given as a string identifier.

### chainType

```dart
Future<ChainType> chainType()
```

Get the chain's type.

### health

```dart
Future<Health> health()
```

Return health status of the node.

Node is considered healthy if it is:

- connected to some peers (unless running in dev mode)
- not performing a major sync

### localPeerId

```dart
Future<String> localPeerId()
```

Returns the base58-encoded PeerId of the node.

### localListenAddresses

```dart
Future<List<String>> localListenAddresses()
```

Returns the multi-addresses that the local node is listening on

The addresses include a trailing `/p2p/` with the local PeerId, and are thus suitable to
be passed to `addReservedPeer` or as a bootnode address for example.

### peers

```dart
Future<List<PeerInfo<H, N>>> peers() async {
```

Returns currently connected peers

unsafe: This method is only active with appropriate flags

### accountNextIndex

```dart
Future<int> accountNextIndex(String account)
```

Returns the next valid index (aka nonce) for given account.

This method takes into consideration all pending transactions
currently in the pool and if no transactions are found in the pool
it fallbacks to query the index from the runtime (aka. state nonce).

### dryRun

```dart
Future<Uint8List> dryRun(Uint8List extrinsic, {BlockHash? at})
```

Dry run an extrinsic at a given block. Return SCALE encoded ApplyExtrinsicResult.

### nodeRoles

```dart
Future<List<String>> nodeRoles()
```

Returns the roles the node is running as.

### properties

```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> properties() async
```

Get a custom set of properties as a JSON object, defined in the chain spec.

### addReservedPeer

```dart
Future<String?> addReservedPeer(String peer)
```

Adds a reserved peer. Returns the empty string or an error. The string
parameter should encode a `p2p` multiaddr.

`/ip4/198.51.100.19/tcp/30333/p2p/QmSk5HQbn6LhUwDiNMseVUjuRYhEtYj4aUZ6WfWoGURpdV`
is an example of a valid, passing multiaddr with PeerId attached.

unsafe: This method is only active with appropriate flags

### removeReservedPeer

```dart
Future<String?> removeReservedPeer(String peerId)
```

Remove a reserved peer. Returns the empty string or an error. The string
should encode only the PeerId e.g. `QmSk5HQbn6LhUwDiNMseVUjuRYhEtYj4aUZ6WfWoGURpdV`.

unsafe: This method is only active with appropriate flags

### reservedPeers

```dart
Future<List<String>> reservedPeers()
```

Returns the list of reserved peers

### addLogFilter

```dart
Future<dynamic> addLogFilter(String directives)
```

Adds the supplied directives to the current log filter
unsafe: This method is only active with appropriate flags

### resetLogFilter

```dart
Future<dynamic> resetLogFilter()
```

Resets the log filter to Substrate defaults
unsafe: This method is only active with appropriate flags

### syncState

```dart
Future<SyncState> syncState()
```

Returns the state of the syncing of the node: starting block, current best block, highest known block.
